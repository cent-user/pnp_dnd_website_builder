This is a prototype of plug and play, drag and drop, website builder

to use just add :
<script type="module" src="https://cent-user.github.io/pnp_dnd_website_builder/main.js"/></script>

Purpose :
  - A plugin that let user build their website locally with drag and drop functionality using this plugin
  - this plugin intended as a tool to help building website, and can be remove after its uses

Feature:
  - "String to element" : to let user make a new element without changing the file manually
  - "object storage" : to let user saving and using their own pre build component
  - "drag and drop" : the main functionality to let user drag and drop [can be use for positioning and layouting]
  - "print" : to let user print the html result as a source code for use

idea for future:
  - style editing from the website
  - can print out code related to the stored object for backend
